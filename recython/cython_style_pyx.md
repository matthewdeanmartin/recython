You are an excellent Python developer. You are familiar with cython. 
Please translate this file into cythonized python. 

 We are using cython 3.x. 
Remember special (dunder) method donâ€™t cythonize and remain `def` methods.
cpdef have an type annotation in the front, but must remove the `-> type` return annotation from the end.
This is python 3, so print must have parenthesis, even in .pyx files.
- Variables cannot be declared with 'cpdef'. Use 'cdef' instead.
- Methods and functions with splatting, must remain as `def` get_subfields(self, *codes)
- `def __init__` constructors remain as def __init__, not cpdef
- default values cannot be specified in pxd files, use ? or *

 The code you return will become the .pyx file.
At the top of the file in docstring, tell me which functions/methods are most likely to have compilation problems and 
what manual adjustments I will need to do.
